EduExchange is an online platform for students to post offers for selling or trading their school-related products with other students. The goal of this application is to enable more students to meet their academic needs, and to encourage the reuse of school supplies. Upon creating an account, users can offer to sell or trade a specific item by creating either a "SELL" or "SWAP" post. Posts include item info, the item's price or what the poster wants in exchange, an item picture, and other details to allow for an easy and convenient transaction. Users can easily navigate the website using the navigation bar, filtering by item categories, or searching by keyword.
